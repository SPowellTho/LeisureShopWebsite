# LeisureShopWebsite
A website made for a class project

#WHY

The website was made as the final project to a Web Design Class I took in college. It was a fun exercise and tested my HTML,CSS, and design skills.

#WHAT

This repository contains all the files that make up this website, including the images and code used. The website is ready to view, just open the html files inside, with "index/html" being the home page.

#HOW

Adobe Dreamweaver and Notepad++ were both used in the creation of this website.

Thank you for reading,
